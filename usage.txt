<emotion of disgust><punctuation>

Testcase 1
Client responds to 'REG|13|Knock, knock.|' from server with incorrect format
Ex: 'REGG|12|Who's there?|'
In this instance server should recognize the incorrect format and sends 
to client the error message: 'ERR|M1FT|' and close the connection

Testcase 2
Client responds to 'REG|13|Knock, knock.|' from server with incorrect content length
Ex: 'REG|8|Who's there?|'
In this instance server should recognize the incorrect content length and send
to client the error message: 'ERR|M1LN|' and close the connection

Testcase 3
Client responds to 'REG|13|Knock, knock.|' from server with incorrect content length
Ex: 'REG|12|Wh0's th3r3?|'
In this instance server should recognize the incorrect message content and send
to client the error message: 'ERR|M1CT|' and close the connection

Testcase 4
Client responds to 'REG|5|Deja.|' from server in multiple sequential parts
Ex: 'REG|10' then '|Deja,' then ' who?|'
In this instance server should continue receiving from client until an error is
recognized or the message is completely sent in the correct format

Testcase 5
Client responds to 'REG|13|Knock, knock!|' from server using expression without ending punctiation
Ex: 'REG|4|Bruh|'
In this instance server should recognize the lack of ending punctiation and send
to client the error message: 'ERR|M5CT|' and close the connection
